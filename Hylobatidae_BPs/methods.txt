Results

We computed the significance of the overlap between the breakpoint regions and a set of possible features of interest using permutation tests. The features examined were genes, segmental duplications, and repeats of the following types: Alu, LINE, ERV, SVA. To look for associations between breakpoint regions and chromatin structure, we also tested the overlap with open chromatin regions in human embryonic stem cells reported by the ENCODE consortium (2011). We found a significant enrichment for genes (Bonferroni adjusted p value = 0.0287), segmental duplications (p=0.0366), Alu (p=0.0000), and SVA (p=0.0008). We did not find significant enrichment for LINE and ERV repeats, nor for the ENCODE open chromatin regions. Systematically shifting the location of breakpoint regions by increments of 10kb up and downstream of their actual location, up to a maximum of 1MB, shows that the locations of the breakpoint regions gives the greatest or close to the greatest number of overlaps with the four significantly overlapping features (genes, segmental duplications, Alu, and SVA) in the local genomic neighborhood. 

We also examined the overlap between the selected features and the subsets of breakpoint regions specific to individual gibbon genera, as well as the subset of breakpoints that are common to all genera, and those that are are shared between more than one but not all genera ("Intermediate"). We found a significant enrichment for genes (Bonferroni adjusted p value = 0.0432) and Alu elements (p = 0.0432) in the NLE breakpoint regions. 

SVA elements are not found in gibbons; therefore, their status as significantly enriched in the human syntenic breakpoint regions is surprising. However, SVAs are known to correlate with Alu elements due to their preference for G+C rich regions of the genome (Wang et al. 2005). It seems likely that the association between human SVA locations and gibbon breakpoint regions is therefore an indirect one, dependent on the presence of additional genomic features present in both humans and gibbons.

Supplemental Methods - Feature Overlap statistics

To determine the significance of the overlap of features with the breakpoint regions we used a permutation approach. While maintaining the chromosomal assignment and length of breakpoint regions, we permuted their start coordinates 10,000 times using BEDTools version 2.16.2 (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). Genomic regions annotated as centromeres and telomeres in the "Gaps" track of the hg19 build were excluded from possible random placements of the regions. Locations of the features were held constant. We then compared the number of features that overlapped a breakpoint region to the observed distribution of results among the randomly permuted regions, and used the quantile of the real observed value in that distribution as an estimate of the p-value of observing a value equal to or greater than the real observation. Estimated p-values were computed in the R programming language and plotted using the ggplot2 library (Wickham 2009).

Repeat elements were extracted from the rmsk table downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser for human build hg19. OCRs were identified using the ENCODE track wgEncodeOpenChromSynthH1hescPk for hg19.
